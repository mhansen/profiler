### Localization for the App UI of Profiler


# Naming convention for l10n IDs: "ComponentName--string-summary".
# This allows us to minimize the risk of conflicting IDs throughout the app.
# Please sort alphabetically by (component name), and
# keep strings in order of appearance.


## The following feature names must be treated as a brand. They cannot be translated.

-firefox-brand-name = Firefox
-profiler-brand-name = Firefox Profiler
-profiler-brand-short-name = Profiler
-firefox-nightly-brand-name = Firefox Nightly

## AppHeader
## This is used at the top of the homepage and other content pages.

AppHeader--app-header = <header>{ -profiler-brand-name }</header> — <subheader>Web app for { -firefox-brand-name } performance analysis</subheader>
AppHeader--github-icon =
    .title = Go to our Git repository (this opens in a new window)

## AppViewRouter
## This is used for displaying errors when loading the application.

AppViewRouter--error-message-unpublished =
    .message = Couldn’t retrieve the profile from { -firefox-brand-name }.
AppViewRouter--error-message-from-file =
    .message = Couldn’t read the file or parse the profile in it.
AppViewRouter--error-message-local =
    .message = Not implemented yet.
AppViewRouter--error-message-public =
    .message = Could not download the profile.
AppViewRouter--error-message-from-url =
    .message = Could not download the profile.
AppViewRouter--route-not-found--home =
    .specialMessage = The URL you tried to reach was not recognised.

## CallNodeContextMenu
## This is used as a context menu for the Call Tree, Flame Graph and Stack Chart
## panels.

CallNodeContextMenu--transform-merge-function = Merge function
    .title =
        Merging a function removes it from the profile, and assigns its time to the
        function that called it. This happens anywhere the function was called in
        the tree.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-merge-call-node = Merge node only
    .title =
        Merging a node removes it from the profile, and assigns its time to the
        function’s node that called it. It only removes the function from that
        specific part of the tree. Any other places the function was called from
        will remain in the profile.
# This is used as the context menu item title for "Focus on function" and "Focus
# on function (inverted)" transforms.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-function-title =
    Focusing on a function will remove any sample that does not include that
    function. In addition, it re-roots the call tree so that the function
    is the only root of the tree. This can combine multiple function call sites
    across a profile into one call node.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-function = Focus on function
    .title = { CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-function-title }
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-function-inverted = Focus on function (inverted)
    .title = { CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-function-title }
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-focus-subtree = Focus on subtree only
    .title =
        Focusing on a subtree will remove any sample that does not include that
        specific part of the call tree. It pulls out a branch of the call tree,
        however it only does it for that single call node. All other calls
        of the function are ignored.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-collapse-function-subtree = Collapse function
    .title =
        Collapsing a function will remove everything it called, and assign
        all of the time to the function. This can help simplify a profile that
        calls into code that does not need to be analysed.
# This is used as the context menu item to apply the "Collapse resource" transform.
# Variables:
#   $nameForResource (String) - Name of the resource to collapse.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-collapse-resource = Collapse <strong>{ $nameForResource }</strong>
    .title =
        Collapsing a resource will flatten out all the calls to that
        resource into a single collapsed call node.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-collapse-direct-recursion = Collapse direct recursion
    .title =
        Collapsing direct recursion removes calls that repeatedly recurse into
        the same function.
CallNodeContextMenu--transform-drop-function = Drop samples with this function
    .title =
        Dropping samples removes their time from the profile. This is useful to
        eliminate timing information that is not relevant for the analysis.
CallNodeContextMenu--expand-all = Expand all
# Searchfox is a source code indexing tool for Mozilla Firefox.
# See: https://searchfox.org/
CallNodeContextMenu--searchfox = Look up the function name on Searchfox

        function was observed to be on the stack. This includes the time where
        the function was actually running, and the time spent in the callers from
        this function.
CallTree--tracing-ms-self = Self (ms)
    .title =
        The “self” time only includes the time where the function was
        the end of the stack. If this function called into other functions,
        then the “other” functions’ time is not included. The “self” time is useful
        for understanding where time was actually spent in a program.
CallTree--samples-total = Total (samples)
    .title =
        The “total” sample count includes a summary of every sample where this
        function was observed to be on the stack. This includes the time where the
        function was actually running, and the time spent in the callers from this
        function.
CallTree--samples-self = Self
    .title =
        The “self” sample count only includes the samples where the function was
        the end of the stack. If this function called into other functions,
        then the “other” functions’ counts are not included. The “self” count is useful
        for understanding where time was actually spent in a program.
CallTree--bytes-total = Total Size (bytes)
    .title =
        The “total size” includes a summary of all of the bytes allocated or
        deallocated while this function was observed to be on the stack. This
        includes both the bytes where the function was actually running, and the
        bytes of the callers from this function.
CallTree--bytes-self = Self (bytes)
    .title =
        The “self” bytes includes the bytes allocated or deallocated while this
        function was the end of the stack. If this function called into
        other functions, then the “other” functions’ bytes are not included.
        The “self” bytes are useful for understanding where memory was actually
        allocated or deallocated in the program.
